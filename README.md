# California Houses Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the California Housing Data, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhirajnirne/california-housing-data).

## Project Overview

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform a thorough analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution, relationships, and patterns of the features.

- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

- Model Building: Develop three models for predicting housing prices: VIG, Lasso, and Ridge. These models will leverage the processed data to make accurate predictions.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files used for the project.

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks documenting the EDA, data preprocessing, and model building steps.

- `models/`: Contains the saved trained models for VIG, Lasso, and Ridge.

- `src/`: Contains any additional source code or utility functions used in the project.
